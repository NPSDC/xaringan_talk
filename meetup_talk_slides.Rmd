# Why make slides in R?

```{r, echo=F, out.width=550, out.height=300}

We've widely embraced tools for importing, tidying, and understanding data programmatically.

We've started to communicate results using RMarkdown documents and Shiny apps or dashboards.

...However, our business partners often expect results to be presented in a standard "slide deck" format.

# Why make slides in R?

Wouldn't it be easier to do all of our data import, tidying, modeling, visualization, and reporting in one place?

  * If results get updated on a schedule (monthly, quarterly), when new data gets released, powerpoint slides quickly become outdated
  * Powerpoint slides are not reproducible
  * Powerpoint slides are not easy to collaborate on or version control (think Git)

# remark.js vs xaringan

Some differences between using remark.js (left) and using **xaringan** (right):

.pull-left[
1. Start with a boilerplate HTML file;

1. Plain Markdown;

1. Write JavaScript to autoplay slides;

1. Manually configure MathJax;

1. Highlight code with `*`;

1. Edit Markdown source and refresh browser to see updated slides;
]

.pull-right[
1. Start with an R Markdown document;

1. R Markdown (can embed R/other code chunks);

1. Provide an option `autoplay`;

1. MathJax just works;<sup>*</sup>

1. Highlight code with `{{}}`;

1. The RStudio addin "Infinite Moon Reader" automatically refreshes slides on changes;

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```


---

# Some Tips

- Slides can be automatically played if you set the `autoplay` option under `nature`, e.g. go to the next slide every 30 seconds in a lightning talk:

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          autoplay: 30000
    ```

--

- A countdown timer can be added to every page of the slides using the `countdown` option under `nature`, e.g. if you want to spend one minute on every page when you give the talk, you can set:

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          countdown: 60000
    ```

    Then you will see a timer counting down from `01:00`, to `00:59`, `00:58`, ... When the time is out, the timer will continue but the time turns red.

# Some Tips

- The title slide is created automatically by **xaringan**, but it is just another remark.js slide added before your other slides.

    The title slide is set to `class: center, middle, inverse, title-slide` by default. You can change the classes applied to the title slide with the `titleSlideClass` option of `nature` (`title-slide` is always applied).

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          titleSlideClass: [top, left, inverse]
    ```
    
--

- If you'd like to create your own title slide, disable **xaringan**'s title slide with the `seal = FALSE` option of `moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        seal: false
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- There are several ways to build incremental slides. See [this presentation](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/incremental.html) for examples.

- The option `highlightLines: true` of `nature` will highlight code lines that start with `*`, or are wrapped in `{{ }}`, or have trailing comments `#<<`;

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          highlightLines: true
    ```

    See examples on the next page.
